# CancerSymptomNetworks
Demo of the application of Bayesian Networks on cancer symptoms.

Below please find attached **a list of interactive Bayesian Networks**, ran on the same set of cancer symptom data. The dataset consisted of 1328 patients, and 38 symptoms. The networks were created by the **symptom dimension of occurrence**. 

The **size of nodes** represent the prevalence of occurrence for each symptom in our dataset. The **width of the edges** are proportional to the strentgh that symptoms connect with each other, based on the conditional probabilities identified with the BN algorithm.

By **clicking on a node** you can see its markov blanket, meaning the specific symptom with its parents and children. You can see the same markov blanket by selecting a symptom by the **menu on the left**.

You can **move each node** in the diagram by click and drag. To **deselect** it click on the white space of the diagram. To **restart the diagram** refresh the page.
