# A few words about me

My name is **Nikolaos Papachristou** and I am currently finishing my PhD on "Machine Learning for Exploring and Predicting Cancer Symptom Clusters" at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing (CVSSP), University of Surrey. My supervisor is Professor [Payam Barnaghi](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/P.Barnaghi/), my co-supervisor is Dr [Sarah Allison](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/nutrition/People/154416/), and my external supervisor is Professor [Christine Miaskowski](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/christine.miaskowski) (University of California, San Francisco). 

Below please find attached a list links of interactive Bayesian Networks, ran on the same set of cancer symptom data. The dataset consisted of 1328 patients, and 38 symptoms. The networks were created by the symptom dimension of occurrence. You will find detailed  information explaining these diagrams inside the following links. 
* [https://nikolaospapachristou.github.io/CancerSymptomNetworks/GSmod1.html](All patients, Grow-Shrink, 0.85 threshold (Sachs et al., 2005))
* [https://nikolaospapachristou.github.io/CancerSymptomNetworks/GSmod2.html](All patients, Grow-Shrink, optimal threshold according to Scurati & Nagarajan (2013))

You can have an overview of my PhD research in my public presentation about ["Data analysis in oncology for predicting cancer patients' symptoms during their chemotherapy treatment", 3rd Health Innovation Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hMLdn9D2Hc) (the slides are in English but the presentation is in Greek).
